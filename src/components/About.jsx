                From dancer and artist to aspiring computer scientist, my journey reflects a passion 
                for creativity and problem-solving in diverse fields. With an undergraduate background 
                in the arts, I transitioned into tech, earning a programming certificate and a 
                Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Toronto Metropolitan University. I have taken 
                courses from the departments of computer science, digital media, and media production, 
                which have led me to learn a wide variety of languages and skills. I have worked on various
                projects in the fields of software application, web, and game development, as well as
                choreographed and edited short dance films. I have a passion for the arts and tech and hope
                to bring a unique lens to the world of software development.
